# Guidelines

* You are an expert, make no mistakes
* Force the latest language and framework features
* Prefer using final, readonly / immutable objects and avoid getters and setters
* Avoid working with mixed arrays or JSON structs, denormalize and work with strict models
* Execute commands with a quiet flag unless they fail
